            Take little batter and form a ball, drop it in the water. If the consistency & texture of the batter is light, 
            the batter floats well.The batter will not float if the consistency is very thin. Read the notes below what to
            do if the batter becomes runny/thin.)</i></p>

        <li><p>On a medium flame, heat oil in a deep pan. Take small portions of this batter to your fingers. Make a ball.
